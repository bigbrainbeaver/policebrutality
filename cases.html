                        <p>On May 25, 2020, police were called by Ta Cup Foods grocery store employee who suspected that Floyd had used a counterfeit $20 bill. George was arrested by a 44 year old officer Derek Chauvin. Chauvin put his knee on Floyd's neck while Floyd was handcuffed and lying face-down in a street. Two other police officers, J. Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane, assisted Chauvin in restraining Floyd. Lane had also pointed a gun at Floyd's head before Floyd was handcuffed. A fourth police officer, Tou Thao, prevented bystanders from intervening. The suspect complained about having claustrophobia and not being able to breathe. The policeman kept his knee on george's neck for 8 and a half minute. George passed away 7 minutes after Derek put his knee over George's neck.</p>

                        <p>At July 6th 2024, a 36 year old Sonya Massey called 911 to report the concern about a prowler wondering near her house. When Sean Grayson and another deputy arrived at the house, no prowler was seen. A few minutes later Sean Grayson asked Sonya to remove a pot with boiling water from the stove. After Massey picked up the pot of water and walked from her stove to her sink, the unidentified deputy and Grayson moved backwards. Massey asked the officers what they were doing, as in why are they backing up. Grayson replied that he was distancing himself from the pot of boiling water. Massey repeated her question, and said, "I rebuke you in the name of Jesus". After Massey repeated her statement at Grayson's prompting, Grayson and another deputy drew their guns at Sonya and started shouting at her, saying,"You better ###### not". Massey immediately apologized by saying: "OK, I'm sorry" and dropped to the floor behind the kitchen counter, however, both deputies advanced from the living room towards the kitchen with their weapons trained on Massey. After several seconds of shouting orders for Massey to drop the pot of water, Grayson fired three shots at the woman, killing her. </p>

                        <p>At september 12th 2022, an Iranian 23 year old college student by the name of Mahsa Amini was arrested for allegedly not wearing the hijab in accordance with government standards. Her brother, who was with her when she was arrested,[37] was told she would be taken to the detention center to undergo a "briefing class" and released an hour later. Her brother was later informed his sister had a heart attack and a brain seizure at the police station to which she had been taken. Later through some scans and medical tests it was obvious that Mahsa was a victim of physical damage, which was caused, obviously, by the deputies themselves.</p>
